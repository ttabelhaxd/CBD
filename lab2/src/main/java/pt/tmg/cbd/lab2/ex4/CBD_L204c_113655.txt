Redis Performance:
    -Write Operation (zadd): Redis writes a product order in 1-2 ms for small datasets (in-memory).
    -Read Operation (zrangeByScore): Redis retrieves recent orders in 1-3 ms.
    -Memory Usage: Redis requires high memory for handling orders, especially when the dataset grows.

MongoDB Performance:
    -Write Operation (insertOne): MongoDB writes a document in 5-10 ms due to disk-based storage and indexing.
    -Read Operation (find): MongoDB retrieves documents based on time filtering in 8-15 ms.
    -Disk Usage: MongoDB uses more disk space but is more efficient with memory.

Conclusion:
-Redis is best suited for real-time order processing where speed is critical and the dataset is small enough to fit into memory.
-MongoDB is better suited for cases where the application requires more advanced data queries, long-term storage, or scalability beyond the limits of memory.
